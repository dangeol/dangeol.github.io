  <p>If you have no satisfactory teacher, then take this sure Dhamma and practice it. For the Dhamma is sure and when it is rightly undertaken it will be to your welfare and happiness for a long time.</p>

  <p>The Lord said to the monks: “Imagine that the whole earth was covered with water, and that a man was to throw a yoke with a hole in it into the water. Blown by the wind, that yoke would drift north, south, east and west. Now suppose that once in a hundred years a blind turtle was to rise to the surface. What would be the chances of that turtle putting his head through the hole in the yoke as he rose to the surface once in a hundred years?” ‘It would be very unlikely, Lord.’ “Well, it is just as unlikely that one will be born as a human being. It is just as unlikely that a Tathagata, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, should appear in the world. And it is just as unlikely that the Dhamma and discipline of the Tathagata should be proclaimed. But now you have been born as a human being, a Tathagata has appeared and the Dhamma has been proclaimed. Therefore, strive to realize the Four Noble Truths.”<br />

  <p>For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher’s instruction and who lives in harmony with it, his thinking is: ‘The Teacher is the Lord, I am the disciple. The Lord knows, I do not.’ For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and who lives in harmony with it, the Teacher's instruction is nourishing and strength-giving. The thinking is: ‘Gladly would I have my skin, bone and sinews wither and my flesh dry up, if only I can struggle until I win that which can be won by human effort.’ And for a disciple who has faith in the Teacher’s instruction and who lives in harmony with it, one of two results can be expected; profound knowledge here and now, or if there is any basis for rebirth remaining, the state of Non-Returning.<br />

  <p>Unsurpassed is the Lord’s way of teaching the Dhamma concerning one’s proper moral conduct. One should be honest and faithful, without deception, chatter, hinting or belittling, not always ready to add gain to gain, but with the sense-doors guarded, moderate in food, a promoter of peace, observant, active and strenuous in effort, a meditator, mindful, with proper conversation, steady-going, resolute and sensible, not hankering after sense pleasures, but mindful and prudent. This is the unsurpassed teaching concerning a person's proper ethical conduct. This, the Lord fully comprehends and beyond it nothing lies to be further comprehended. And in such matters there is no other monk or brahman who is greater or more enlightened than the Lord concerning one's moral conduct.</p>

  <p>As long as the sun and the moon have not come to be, there is no shining forth of great light, no great radiance. Only darkness and blindness prevail. There is no day or night; no months, fortnights or seasons are distinguishable. But when the sun and the moon have come to be, then there is a shining forth of great light, of great radiance. Darkness and blindness are no more. Days, nights, months, fortnights and seasons are distinguishable.</p>

  <p>In the same way, as long as the Tathagata, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha, has not come to be, there is no shining forth of great light, no great radiance.

  <p>I will teach you the Noble Eightfold Path; I will analyze it for you. Listen carefully and I will speak. And what is the Noble Eightfold Path? It is Perfect View, Perfect Thought, Perfect Speech, Perfect Action, Perfect Livelihood, Perfect Effort, Perfect Mindfulness and Perfect Concentration. And What is Perfect View? It is the knowledge of suffering, the cause of suffering, the overcoming of suffering and the way to the overcoming of suffering. And what is Perfect Thought? It is the thought of giving up, the thought of love, and the thought of helpfulness. And what is Perfect Speech? It is the avoiding of lying, slanderous, harsh speech and of idle chatter. And what is Perfect Action? It is the avoiding of killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. And what is Perfect Livelihood? Concerning this, a noble disciple, by giving up wrong means of livelihood, adopts a perfect livelihood. And what is Perfect Effort? Concerning this, one puts forth the desire, makes an effort, strives, applies the mind and directs it to prevent the arising of evil unskilled states not yet arisen, to destroy evil unskilled states that have already risen, to arouse skillful states that have not yet arisen, and finally, puts forth the desire, makes an effort, strives, applies the mind and directs it towards the continuation, the unification, the growth, the development and the fulfillment of skillful states of mind. And what is Perfect Mindfulness? Concerning this, one abides contemplating body in body, feeling in feeling, mind in mind and mental states in mental states, ardent, clearly conscious so as to control the attraction and repulsion in the world. And what is Perfect Concentration? Concerning this one cultivates the four jhanas.</p>

If someone killed me, I would not like it. Likewise, if I were to kill someone they would not like it. For what is unpleasant to me must be unpleasant to another, so how could I inflict unpleasantness on them?’ As a result of such reflection one abstains from killing, encourages others to abstain from it and speaks in praise of such abstaining.</p>

Just as a stick from a funeral pyre, burning at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle, serves no useful purpose as fuel in the village or as timber in the forest- using such a simile do I speak of those concerned neither with their own good nor the good of the others. Those concerned with the good of others but not their own are more excellent and higher than this. Those who are concerned with their own good but not that of others are more excellent and higher still. But those who are concerned with both their own good and the good of others – they are, of these four persons, the supreme, the highest the topmost and the best. Just as from a cow comes milk, from milk cream, from cream butter, from butter ghee, and from ghee the skimming of ghee, which is said to be the best, even so, those who are concerned with their own good and the good of others are, of these four persons, the supreme, the highest, the topmost and the best.</p>

  <p>If a fool was sitting in an assembly hall, in the main street or at the crossroads and people were to talk about him, and if he were one who broke the Five Precepts, he would think: ‘These people are talking about me because I have done these things.’ This is the first kind of anguish and dejection that the fool experiences here and now. Again, a fool might see the king arrest a thief or a wrongdoer and punish him. Upon seeing this, the fool would think: ‘The king is punishing that wrongdoer. Now, I have done these things also, so if the king were to know about me, he might punish me too.’ This is the second kind of anguish and dejection that the fool experiences here and now. And further, while the fool is sitting in a chair, lying on a bed or on the ground, those evil deeds that he has previously done with body, speech or mind, come to rest on him, lie on him, settle on him, just as when at evening, the shadows of the great mountains come to rest, lie and settle on the ground. At such times, the fool thinks: ‘Oh indeed, what is beautiful and skillful has not been done by me. I have made no refuge against the fearful. There is a place for those who have not done good but only evil, and to there I will go.’ And so he grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, cries and falls into disillusionment.

Breathing in a long breath one knows: ‘I am breathing in a long breath;’ breathing out a long breath one knows: ‘I am breathing out a long breath.’ Breathing in a short breath one knows: ‘I am breathing in a short breath;’ breathing out a short breath one knows: ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’ One trains oneself, thinking: ‘Breathing in I shall experience the whole body.’ One trains oneself, thinking: ‘Breathing out I shall experience the whole body.’ One trains oneself, thinking: ‘Breathing in I will tranquillize bodily activities.’ One trains oneself, thinking: ‘Breathing out I will tranquillize bodily activities.’</p>

  <p>Those families where the mother and father are worshipped in the home are said to be like Brahma, like teachers of old, they are ranked with the ancient gods. Truly worthy of offerings are those families where the mother and father are worshipped in the home. ‘Brahma,’ ‘teachers of old,’ ‘teachers of old,’ ‘gods of old,’ and ‘worthy of offerings’ are terms for a mother and father. And why is this? Because a mother and father do much for their children – they bring them up, nourish them and introduce them to the world.</p>

  <p>There are these five strands of sense pleasure. What five? Material shapes cognizable with the eye, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring.

These are the five strands of sense pleasure.</p>

  <p>Whatever happiness or joy arises as a result of these five strands of sense pleasure, that is called the happiness of sense of pleasure.

  <p>One who is intent on developing higher thought should attend to five things from time to time. What five? If, while attending to something, evil unskillful thoughts associated with greed, hatred and delusion should arise, then one should attend instead to something that is skillful. Then these evil unskillful thoughts will subside and the mind will be steady, calmed, one-pointed and concentrated. It is just as if a carpenter or his apprentice might knock out, drive out, draw out a large peg with a small one.</p>

  <p>If, while attending to something that is skilled, evil unskillful thoughts associated with greed, hatred and delusion still arise, then one should ponder the disadvantages of those thoughts, thinking: ‘Truly, these thoughts are unskillful, blameworthy and conducive to suffering.’ Then those evil unskillful thoughts will subside and the mind will be steady, calm, one-pointed and concentrated. It is just as if a well-dressed young man or woman, on having the carcass of a snake, a dog or a human being hung around his or her neck would be repelled, ashamed and disgusted.</p>

  <p>If, however, while pondering the disadvantages of these thoughts, evil unskilled thoughts associated with greed, hatred and delusion still arise, then one should forget about them, pay them no attention. Then those evil unskillful thoughts will subside and the mind will be steady, calm, one-pointed and concentrated. It is just as if a man with sight might shut his eyes or turn away in order to avoid seeing something.</p>

  <p>But if, while trying to forget about and pay attention to those thoughts, evil unskillful thoughts associated with greed, hatred and delusion still arise, then one should allow them to settle. Then those evil unskillful thoughts will subside and the mind will be steady, calm, one-pointed and concentrated. It is just as if a man, finding no reason for running, walks; then finding no reason for walking, stands; then finding no reason for standing, sits down; then finding no reason for sitting, lies down. Thus he goes from a strenuous posture to a more relaxed one.</p>

  <p>But if, while allowing those thoughts to settle, evil unskillful thoughts associated with greed, hatred and delusion still arise, then, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the palate one should restrain, subdue and suppress the mind with the mind. Then those evil unskillful thoughts will subside and the mind will be steady, calm, one-pointed and concentrated. It is just as if a strong man should hold down a weaker one by seizing his head and shoulders.</p>

  <p>One who does these things is called a master of the pathways of thought. The thought he wants to think, he thinks; the thought he does not want to think, he does not think. He has cut off craving, removed the fetters, mastered pride and put an end to suffering.</p>

  <p>There are these five right times for striving. What five? Concerning this, one is young, youthful, blacked-haired, blessed with the beauty of youth and in the prime of life. This is the first right time for striving. Then, one has health, well-being and a digestion that is not over-hot or over-cool. This is the second right time. If there is no famine and the crops are good, with food easy to get and one can easily live on gleanings and favours, this is the third good time. When people live in friendly fellowship, harmonious as milk and water mixed, without quarrels and looking upon each other with the eyes of love, this is the fourth good time. Again, when the Sangha dwells in friendly fellowship, content with one teaching, then there is no reviling one another, no accusation, quarrelling or contention, so that those with little faith find faith, and the faith of those already faithful grows, this is the fifth right time for striving.</p>

Then he called his attendant and said: “Friend, go to the Lord and in my name worship his feet, tell him I am suffering from a disease and suggest that it would be good if he were to come and visit me out of compassion for me.” So the attendant did as he was asked. In silence the Lord consented and dressing himself and taking his robe and bowl, set out. Now Vakkali saw the Lord coming in the distance and struggled to rise from his bed. But the Lord saw him and said: “Enough, Vakkali. Remain in your bed. There are seats made ready. I will sit there.” Having seated himself, the Lord addressed Vakkali saying: “I hope you are bearing up. I hope you are enduring. Are the pains decreasing or abating? Do they seem to be decreasing or abating?”<br />
  “No, Lord. I am not bearing up or enduring, the pains do not decrease, neither do they grow.”</p>

  <p>Four things lead to worldly progress. What four? Achievement in alertness, in caution, in good friendship and achievement in balanced livelihood. And what is achievement in alertness? Concerning this, in whatever way one earns a living, whether by farming, trading, cattle rearing, archery, service to the king or by some craft, in that one becomes deft and tireless, gifted with an inquiring turn of mind into ways and means, and able to arrange and carry out the job properly.</p>

  <p>And what is achievement in caution? Concerning this, whatever wealth one acquired by energetic striving, won by strength of arm and sweat of brow, justly and lawfully, one husbands, watches and guards so that kings do not confiscate it, thieves do not steal it, fire or water do not destroy it, and unwanted heirs do not remove it.</p>

  <p>And what is good friendship? Concerning this, in whatever village or town one lives, one associates with, converses with, discusses things with people either young or old, who are cultured, full of faith, full of virtue, full of charity and full of wisdom. One acts in accordance with the faith of the faithful, the virtue of the virtuous, the charity of the charitable and the wisdom of the wise.</p>

  <p>And what is balanced livelihood? Concerning this, one knows both his income and expenditure and lives neither extravagantly nor miserly, knowing that income after expenditure will stand at so much and that expenses will not exceed income. Just as a goldsmith or his apprentice holding up the scales, knows that it has dipped down by so much or that it has tilted up by so much, one knows one’s income and one’s expenditure. If one with small income were to lead an extravagant life people would say: ‘He enjoys his wealth like a wood-apple eater.’ Likewise, if one with a good income were to be miserly, people would say: ‘He will die like a beggar.’</p>

  <p>Then Venerable Sariputta said: “There are these five ways of putting away malice that arises. What five? Take the case of a person who is impure in deed but not in word. Suppose a monk who wears rag robes were to see a rag on the road. He would hold it with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot to see if he could make use of it, and then proceed on his way. In the same way, one who is impure in deed but not in word, his deed ought to be disregarded. Think instead about his ways that are pure.</p>

  <p>And concerning one who words are impure but who is pure in deed, how should malice be put away? Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pond overgrown with mossy slime and water plants. He would dive into the pond, scatter the water plants this way and that, cup his hands, drink, and then go his way refreshed. In the same way, one whose words are impure but who is pure in deed, his words ought to be disregarded. Think instead about his ways that are pure.</p>

  <p>And what of one whose words and deed are both impure, but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm? Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied craving and thirsty, were to come upon a puddle in a cow's footprint. He might think: ‘If I drink from this puddle using my hands or a cup I will stir up the mud and make it unfit to drink. I will crouch down on all fours, bend low and drink, as does a cow?’ Then he does this. In the same way, one whose word and deed are both impure but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm from time to time, his words and deeds ought to be disregarded. Think only of his clarity and calm.</p>

  <p>And what of one whose words and deeds are both impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm? Suppose a sick ailing and grievously ill man was going along a highway with no village in front or behind, unable to get proper food, medicine or attention, or even a guide to the next village. If another man were to see him, he might feel pity and he might say to himself: ‘This poor man! He should get help or he will suffer to his detriment.’ In the same way, for one whose ways are impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm, pity, compassion and commiseration ought to arise and you should think: ‘This poor man! He should give up the bad and develop the good, or else after death he will have a bad rebirth.’</p>

  <p>And concerning one whose words and deeds are both pure and who has mental clarity and calm, how should malice be put away? Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pool of sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place shaded by all kinds of trees. He would dive into the pond, bathe, drink and then come out and lie in the shade. In the same way, of this person, think about this person’s pure words, deeds and his mental clarity and calm.”</p>

  <p>One who is serious is a believer, not an unbeliever. One who is serious is energetic, not lazy, of steady not distracted mindfulness, of clear not confused comprehension and with strong wisdom, not weak wisdom. When you have established these five things in yourself, you should also make six other things grow within you. You should recollect the Tathagata like this: ‘Such indeed is the Lord, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, with perfect knowledge and conduct, happily attained, a knower of the worlds, a guide unsurpassed of those to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, the Lord.’</p>

  <p>You should recollect the Dhamma like this: ‘Beautifully taught is the Lord’s Dhamma, immediately apparent, timeless, of the nature of a personal invitation, progressive, to be attained by the wise, each for themselves.’</p>

  <p>You should recollect the Sangha like this: ‘Happily and straightly faring are the Lord’s disciples, correctly and methodically faring are the Lord’s disciples, namely, the four pairs of individuals, the eight types of persons. These disciples of the Lord are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts and salutation with folded hands; they are an incomparable source of goodness in the world.’</p>

  <p>You should recollect your own virtues as being complete, whole, unspotted, untarnished, freedom-giving, as being praised by the wise, pure and leading to concentration.</p>

  <p>You should recollect your own generosity like this: ‘It is a gain for me. Indeed, it is a great gain, that amidst those overcome by meanness, I live at home with the mind cleansed of meanness. I am open-handed, pure-handed, delighting in sharing, one to ask a favour of, one who rejoices in giving.’</p>

  <p>Further, you should recollect the gods in this way: ‘There are the gods of the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-three Gods, the gods of Yama, the gods of delight, the gods who delight in creation, those who have power over the creations of others, those in the company of Brahma and those beyond that. I, too, have the faith, the virtue, the learning, the generosity, and the wisdom by which these gods, on dying here, were reborn there in heaven.’</p>

  <p>At a time when a noble disciple recollects all these things, his mind is free from greed, hatred and delusion. At that time, his mind is straight and fixed upon those things, and with a straight mind he expresses the gladness of the good, the gladness of the Dhamma, and the gladness that goes with Dhamma. In one like this gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated. This is said of a person like this: ‘The noble disciple who recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, who recollects virtue, generosity and the gods – that disciple walks evenly among those who dwell unevenly.’</p>

  <p>The Lord asked, Asibandhakaputta, a follower of Nigantha Nataputta: “What doctrine does Nigantha Nataputta teach his disciples?”</p>

  <p>“Lord, Nataputta teaches that whoever kills, steals, commits sexual misconduct or lies – that person goes to hell. According to how one habitually acts, one goes to one’s destiny.”</p>

  <p>“But if you say that as one acts habitually one goes to one's destiny, then according to Nataputta’s teaching, no one would go to hell. What do you think about this? If a man say, kills by day or night or from time to time, which time is the most habitual to him? When he kills or when he is not killing?”</p>

  <p>“Well, Lord, the time when he is not killing is most habitual to him.”</p>

  <p>“Now, say a teacher teaches a doctrine such as this and a follower has faith in such a teacher. That follower would think: ‘My teacher says that whoever kills, steals, commit sexual misconduct or lies goes to hell. Now I have done these things so I will to go to hell.’ And so, holding this view, not giving it up, thinking about it, ruminating over it, he does go to hell. But say a Tathagata arises in the world. He censures, strongly censures, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying, saying: ‘Abstain from these things.’ Then say a follower has faith in such a teacher, that follower would think: ‘The Lord in many ways censures, strongly censures, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying, saying: Abstain from these things. Now I have done such things. That is not well done, it is not good. Moreover, I may be remorseful when I remember that such deeds cannot be undone.’ Thinking in this way, he abandons such deeds. In this way he goes beyond evil deeds. By abandoning killing, he abstains from killing, by abandoning stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, backbiting, harsh speech, and idle chatter he abstains from all these things. By abandoning greed, he becomes generous, by abandoning hatred he becomes kind, and by abandoning wrong view he becomes one with perfect view. This noble disciple, freed from greed and hatred, not bewildered but mindful and concentrated, abides suffusing the four quarters of the world, above, below, across, everywhere, all beings, the whole world with a mind filled with love, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity that is widespread, grown great. Just as a strong conch blower with but little effort gives notice to the four quarters, in the same way, nothing whatsoever is left out of that love, that compassion, that sympathetic joy or that equanimity.”</p>

  <p>There are four types of people who should be known as enemies disguised as friends; the greedy person, one who speaks but does not act, the flatterer and the squanderer. The greedy person is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons. He is greedy, he gives little and asks for much, if he does what he should, it is only out of fear, and he pursues his own interests only. He who speaks but does not act is an enemy disguised as friend for four reasons. He reminds you of the good he did for you in the past, he talks of good he will do for you in the future, he tries to win your favour with empty words, and when the opportunity to help you arises, he pleads helplessness. The flatterer is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons. He encourages you to do wrong, he discourages you from doing right, he praises you to your face and speaks ill of you behind your back. The squanderer is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons also. He is your companion when you drink, when you frequent the streets at untimely hours, when you haunt low shows and fairs, and he is your companion when you gamble.</p>

  <p>There are four kinds of good-hearted people who should be known as true friends; the helper, the consistent friend, one who gives good counsel, and one who sympathizes. The helper is a true friend for four reasons. He guards you when you are off your guard, he guards your property when you are off your guard, he comforts you when you are afraid, and when something has to be done, he gives you twice what you require. The consistent friend is a true friend for four reasons. He tells you his secrets, he keeps the secrets you tell him, in trouble he does not forsake you, and he would even lay down his life for you. The friend who gives good counsel is a true friend for four reasons. He discourages you from doing wrong, he encourages you to do good, he tells you things you have not heard, and he points out the way to heaven. The friend who sympathizes is a true friend for four reasons. He is sad at your misfortunes, he rejoices at your good fortune, he restrains others from speaking ill of you, and he commends those who speak well of you.</p>

Just as a man tortured by heat, overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty, might come to a pool of clear, sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place, and might plunge in, bathe, drink, and allay all woe, fatigue and fretting – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, all woe, fatigue and fretting is wholly allayed.”</p>

  <p>When he had said this, the Brahmin Karanapalin arose from his seat, arranged his upper robe on his shoulder, set his right knee on the ground and bending forth his outstretched hands towards where the Lord was, said three times: “Homage to the Lord, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. Wonderful is it, Pingiyanin, truly wonderful. Just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over, revealed something covered, showed a blind man the way, brought a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see – in the same way, you have illuminated this Dhamma in many a way. I too will go to the good Gotama, the Dhamma and the Sangha as my refuge. Look upon me as a lay disciple gone for refuge from now until as long as life lasts.”</p>

  <p>The brahmin Sangarava said to the Lord: “Good Gotama, we brahmins perform the sacrifice and encourage others to do so. Whoever does this creates much good that benefits many people. But one who goes forth from home into homeless life as a monk only benefits himself, only calms himself, leads only himself to Nirvana. I say that such a person is practicing something that benefits only himself.”</p>

  <p>And the Lord said: “Well, brahmin, I will ask you a question, answer as you think fit. Let us say a Tathagata arises in the world, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, with perfect knowledge and conduct, happily attained, a knower of the worlds, a guide unsurpassed for people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, the Lord. And then he says: ‘Come! By my own power of realization I have attained great happiness as a result of this practice, this way. You practice it too! By your own powers of realization you too will attain great happiness as a result of this practice, this way.’ Thus this teacher teaches Dhamma to many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of such people.

  <p>Malunkyaputta said to the Lord: “Sir, as I was meditating, this thought came to me: ‘Those speculative views about the world, whether it is finite or infinite, whether it is both or neither; those speculative views about whether the soul is the same as the body or different from it; those speculative views about whether the Tathagata exists after death or does not, whether he both exists and does not exist, whether he neither exists nor does not exist; the Lord has not addressed these views, he has sidestepped them and ignored them.’ Sir, if you do not explain these views for me, I will leave this training. If you know the answers to these questions, you should explain them to me. And if you don't know, then it would be honest and say so.”</p>

  <p>“But Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, be my disciple, and I will answer all these questions for you?’ ”</p>

  <p>“No, sir.”</p>

  <p>“Then, did you ever say to me: ‘I will become your disciple only if you answer all these questions?’ ”</p>

  <p>“No, sir.”</p>

  <p>“So, who are you and what is your complaint, you foolish man? If one were to say that they would not become my disciple until all these views had been explained by me, he might be dead before it could be done. It is as if a man had been shot by a poisoned arrow and his friends might get a doctor to help him. And he might say: ‘Wait! I do not want the arrow removed until I know the name of the man who shot it, what caste he is, whether he is short or tall, fat or thin. I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow that shot the arrow was a spring bow, a crossbow or a longbow. I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow was made from reed, wood or bamboo, or whether the head of the arrow was a calf-tooth head, an ordinary head, a jagged head or an iron head.’ Long before all these questions could be answered, that man would be dead. In the same way, if someone were to say that they would not become my disciple until all the questions about whether the world is infinite or not were answered, they might be dead before it could be done. Living the holy life could not be said to depend upon whether the world is infinite or not, whether it is both infinite and finite, whether it is neither infinite nor finite or any of the other questions. Whether the world is infinite or not, there is birth, there is aging, there is dying, there is grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, and it is for the ending of this that I teach. Therefore, understand as not explained what has not been explained by me, and understand as explained what has been explained by me. And what has not been explained by me? All these speculative views that you ask about. And why? Because it is not connected with the goal, it is not fundamental to the holy life, it does not conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge or to Nirvana. And what has been explained by me? The Four Noble Truths. And why? Because it is connected with the goal, it is fundamental to the holy life, it does conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge and to Nirvana.”</p>

Further, he has friendship with the beautiful, fellowship with the beautiful, companionship with the beautiful. He is pleasant to speak to, endowed with the qualities that make it easy to speak to, he is patient and clever at grasping the meaning of instructions. Yet again, in all dealings with his fellow monks, whether in matters great or small, he is clever and energetic, possessing the ability to give proper consideration to them, knowing what the right thing is and how to do it. He delights in Dhamma, he rejoices greatly in higher Dhamma and higher discipline, and is pleasant to speak with about it. Yet again, he has resolute energy for abandoning bad qualities; he is stout and strong in acquiring good qualities, not shirking the burden of good qualities. He can attain easily and without difficulty the four jhanas which are of the clearest consciousness and are connected with happiness here and now. He can recall his former lives – one, two, five, ten, a hundred, and a hundred thousand. Yet again, with god-like vision, purified and surpassing that of ordinary people, he can see the rising and passing away of beings. And finally, by the destruction of the defilements, in this very life and by his own comprehension, he attains freedom of mind, freedom through wisdom and he abides in it.

  <p>Then, King Milinda said to Venerable Nagasena: “What is the characteristic of faith?”<br />
  “Faith, Sir, has the characteristic of tranquility and leaping forward.”<br />
  “In what way is tranquility a characteristic of faith?”<br />
  “When faith arises, it destroys the hindrances, and when thought is without the hindrances, it is clear, pure and serene.”<br />
  “Give me a simile.”<br />
  “A king, going along a highway together with his army of four parts – elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry – might cross a small stream, and the water might become dirty, turbid and muddy by being disturbed by the army. Then, the king might say: ‘Bring water, good sirs, I want to drink.’ They might answer him, saying: ‘Yes, your Majesty,’ and taking the king's water-cleansing gem might put it in the water so that the various water plants would disappear, the mud subside and the water become clear, pure and serene. Then they would offer the water to the king, saying: ‘Let His Majesty drink.’<br />
  Thought is like the water, the people are like the earnest students of meditation, the defilements are like the water plants and mud, and faith is like the water-cleansing gem. As the water plants disappear, the mud subsides, and the water become clear, pure and serene when the water-cleansing gem is put in it – even so, the arising of faith destroys the hindrances and thought without hindrances is clear, pure and serene.”</p>

  <p>“How, reverend sir, is leaping forward a characteristic of faith?”</p>

  <p>“As, Sir, the earnest student of meditation, on seeing that the minds of others are freed, leaps forward after the fruits of Stream-Winning, of Once-Returning, of Non-Returning or of Arahantship, and practices meditation for the attainment of the unattained, for the mastery of the unmastered, for the realization of the unrealized. In this way is leaping forward a characteristic of faith.”<br />
  “Give me a simile.”<br />
  “A great rain cloud might pour down rain on a high mountain, so that the water rushing down the incline, after filling the gullies, the valleys and the small streams on the slopes, would fill the river, so that it would rush along, breaking its banks. Now, if a great crowd of people were to approach that river knowing neither its width nor depth, they would stand terrified and hesitant on its bank. Then, if a man were to approach who was confident of his own power and strength, and putting on a loincloth, were to dive into that river he would cross over. The other people, seeing that he had crossed over, would then cross over, too. Even so, Sir, the earnest student of meditation, on seeing that the minds of others are freed, leaps forward after the fruits of Stream-Winning, of Once-Returning or of Arhantship, and practices meditation for the attainment of the unattained, for the mastery of the unmastered, for the realization of the unrealized, and thus is leaping forward a characteristic of faith.”</p>

  <p>The noble quality of love should be thought about like this: ‘One concerned only with his own welfare, without concern for others, cannot achieve success in this world or happiness in the next. How then can one wishing to help all beings but not having loved himself succeed in attaining Nirvana? And if you wish to lead all beings to Nirvana, you should begin by wishing for their mundane welfare here and now.’ One should think: ‘I cannot provide for the welfare and happiness of others merely by wishing it. Let me make an effort to accomplish it.’ One should think: ‘Now I support them by promoting their welfare and happiness, and later they will be my companions in sharing the Dhamma.’ Then one should think: ‘Without these beings, I could not perfect the requisites of enlightenment. Because they are the reason for practicing and perfecting all the Buddha-like qualities, these beings are for me the highest field of merit, the incomparable basis for planting wholesome roots, and thus the ultimate object of reverence.’ So one should arouse an especially strong inclination towards promoting the welfare of all beings. And why should love be developed towards all beings? Because it is the foundation of compassion. For when one delights in providing for the welfare and happiness of other beings with an unbounded heart, the desire to remove their afflictions and suffering becomes strongly and firmly established. And compassion is the pre-eminent quality in Buddhahood; it is its basis, its foundation, its root, its head and its chief.</p>

Maybe you think: ‘Alas, when I am gone, my wife will be unable to support the children or keep the household together.’ But do not think like that. For I am skilled in spinning cotton and carding wool and I will manage to support the children and keep the household together after you are gone. Maybe you think: ‘My wife will take another husband after I am gone.’ But do not think like that, for you and I know that for sixteen years we have lived as householders in the holy life. Or maybe you think: ‘After I am gone, my wife will have no desire to see the Lord or to see the monks.’ But do not think like that, for my desire to see them shall be even greater. Or maybe you think: ‘My wife will not keep the virtues in full.’ But do not think like that, for as long as the Lord has female disciples dressed in white, living at home and keeping the virtues in full, I shall be one. And if any doubt it, let them ask the Lord. Or maybe you think: ‘After I am gone, my wife will not have a calm mind.’ But do not think like that, for as long as the Lord has female disciples dressed in white, living at home, who gain that state, I shall be one. And if any doubt it, let them ask the Lord. Or maybe you think: ‘My wife will not win a firm foundation, a firm foothold in this Dhamma and discipline, she will not win comfort, dissolve doubt, be free from uncertainty, become confident, self-reliant, and live by the Teacher’s words.’ But do not think like that, either. For as long as the Lord has female disciples dressed in white, living at home, who win a firm foundation, a firm foothold, who have won comfort, dissolved doubt, who are free from uncertainty, who have become confident, self-reliant and live by the Teacher's words, I shall be one.

Then a servant or underling thinks: ‘If only that wealth didn't belong to them.’ Or suppose a monk or brahmin gets a good supply of robes, food, lodging or medicine for sickness, and another monk or brahmin thinks: ‘If only he didn't get a good supply of those things.’ This is called wrongful envy and is not abandoned by acts of body or speech, but by seeing it with wisdom.</p>

  <p>There are these six ways of being considerate. What six? One has love in deed toward one’s companions in the holy life, both openly and in private. One has love in word toward one’s companions in the holy life, both openly and in private. One has love in thought toward one’s companions in the holy life, both openly and in private. Then, things acquired rightly and properly, be they only scraps in one’s bowl, one gladly and impartially shares it with them. Also, one has those virtues that are unbroken, without flaw, spotless, without blemish, bringing freedom, conducive to concentration, and with these one lives in harmony with one’s fellows in the holy life. And finally, one has that noble understanding that is liberating, leading those who acts accordingly to it the complete overcoming of suffering; and one lives with this understanding among one's companions in the holy life.

  <p>Once The Lord addressed the monks saying: “Once there was a certain king in this very city of Savatthi. He called someone, saying: ‘Come my good man, go and gather together in one place all the men in Savatthi who were born blind.’ ‘Very good,’ said the man, and he did as the king commanded. When he had done so the king said to him: ‘Now, my good man, show these blind men an elephant.’ ‘Very good,’ said the man, and he did as the king commanded. He presented one blind man with the head of the elephant, one with the ear, one with the tusk, another the trunk, the foot, the back, the tail and the tuft of the tail, saying to each other as he did so, ‘O blind man, this is an elephant.’ Having done this the man went to the king and said: ‘Sir, the elephant has been presented to the blind men. Do what you will.’ So, the king went to the blind men and said to each: ‘Oh blind men, have you seen the elephant?’ ‘Yes, Sir, we have,’ they replied: ‘Then tell me what an elephant is like.’ The one who had been presented with the head said: ‘An elephant is like a pot.’ The one who has been presented with the ear said: ‘An elephant is like a winnowing basket.’ They said the tusk was like a ploughshare, the trunk like a plough pole, the body like a granary, the foot like a pillar, the back like a mortar, the tail like a pestle, and the tuft of the tail like a broom. Then they began to argue with each other, shouting as they did: ‘It is!’ It is not!’ ‘An elephant is not like that!’ ‘Yes it is!’ Soon they began to hit each other, and the king was delighted with what he saw. In the same way, wanderers of other sects are blind, they do not see, they do not know the skillful or the unskillful. They do not know what is Dhamma or what Dhamma is not and because of their ignorance they are by nature argumentative, quarrelsome and contentious, wounding each other with the weapon of the tongue.” Then the Lord spoke this verse:</p>

  <p>I tell you this. Let an intelligent person who is sincere, honest and straightforward come to me, and I will instruct him, I will teach him Dhamma. If he practices as he is taught, then in seven years he will attain in this very life by his own knowledge and vision that goal for the sake of which young men go forth from home into homelessness, and he will abide in it. Never mind seven years, he will be able to do it in seven days. Now, you may think: ‘The monk Gotama only says this in order to get disciples.’ But this is not so; let he who is your teacher be your teacher still. You may think: ‘He wants us to give up our commandments.’ But this is not so; continue to live by your commandments. Or you may think: ‘He wants us to give up our way of life.’ But this is not so; continue to live your way of life. Or perhaps you will think: ‘He wants us to practice things that are wrong or not practice things that are right, according to our teachings.’ But this is not so; continue to avoid the things your teaching considers wrong, and practice the things that your teaching considers right. But there are unskillful things not yet given up, things tainted, leading to rebirth, fearful, with painful result in the future, things associated with birth, decay and death. And it is for the giving up of these things that I teach Dhamma. However, if you practice correctly, these tainted things will be given up, and the things that lead to the purification will grow and develop. You will attain the fullness of perfected wisdom by your own knowledge and vision, and abide in it in this very life.</p>

Kisa Gotami had not known death before and when they came to remove the child's body for cremation, she refused to let them do so, saying to herself: “I will get medicine for my son.” Placing the dead child on her hip, she went from house to house, pleading: “Do you know a cure for my son?” Everyone said to her: “Woman, you are completely mad in seeking medicine for your son,” but she went away, thinking: “Truly, I will find someone who knows the right medicine for my child.” Now a certain wise man saw her and thought to himself: “I must help her.” So he said: “Woman, I do not know if there is a cure for your child, but there is one who will know and I know him.”</p>

  <p>“Sir, who is it who will know?”</p>

  <p>“Woman, the Lord will know. Go and ask him.”</p>

  <p>So, she went to the Lord, paid reverence to him, stood at one side and asked: “Venerable sir, is it true as people say that you will know a cure for my child?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, I know.”</p>

  <p>“What then do I need?”</p>

  <p>“A few mustard seeds.”</p>

  <p>“I will get them, Venerable sir, but in whose house?”</p>

  <p>“Get them from a house where no son or daughter or any other person has ever died.”</p>

  <p>“Very well, sir,” Kisa Gotami said, and having paid reverence to the Lord, and having placed the dead child on her hip, she went to the village and stopped at the very first house.<br />
  “Have you any mustard seeds? They say they will cure my child.” They gave her the seeds, and then she asked: “Friend, has any son or daughter died in this house?”<br />
  “What do you ask, woman? The living are few and the dead are many.” “Then take back your seeds, for they will not cure my child,” she said, and returned the seeds they had given her. In this way she went from house to house but never did she find one that had the mustard seeds that she needed. Then she thought: “Oh! It is a difficult task that I have. I thought it was only I who had lost a child, but in every village the dead are more than the living.” While she reflected thus, her heart which had trembled now become still.</p>

  <p>Giving up worldly desires, one dwells with a mind purified and free from worldly desires. Giving up ill-will and hatred, one dwells with a mind filled with compassion and love for the welfare of all beings, and purifies the mind of ill-will and hatred. Giving up sloth and laziness, one perceives the light, and mindful and clearly comprehending, purifies the mind of sloth and laziness. Giving up restlessness and worry and remaining inwardly calm, one purifies the mind of restlessness and worry. Giving up doubt, one dwells having crossed over doubt, and without uncertainty as to what is skillful, purifies the mind of doubt.</p>

  <p>Just as a man who had borrowed money to develop his business, and whose business had prospered, might repay the money and have enough left over to support a wife, and would think: ‘Before I was in debt, but now I am free from debt,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who was sick and suffering, without appetite and weak, might in time regain his health, appetite and strength, and would think: ‘Before I was sick, but now I am healthy,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who is imprisoned might, after a time, be freed without any confiscation of his property, and would think: ‘Before I was imprisoned, but now I am free,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who is enslaved, not his own master, controlled by another and unable to do as he desired, and who in time would be emancipated, would think: ‘I was a slave, but now I am emancipated,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a traveller carrying goods and wealth might find himself in a wilderness with little food and much danger, and after a time, might arrive safe and sound at the edge of a village, and would think: ‘Before I was in danger, but now I am safe,’ and would be glad and happy because of that.</p>

  <p>In the same way, as long as the five hindrances are not given up, one feels indebted, sick, imprisoned, enslaved, lost in the wilderness. But when the five hindrances are given up, one feels free from debt, healthy, free, emancipated and safe. And when one knows that these five hindrances are given up, gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated.</p>

  <p>Once while Venerable Ananda was dwelling near Kosambi in Ghosita Park, Bhaddaji approached and him and Ananda asked him: “Good Bhaddaji, what is the highest of sights, the highest of sounds, the highest of joys, the highest of conscious states, the highest state of being?”<br />
  “There is Brahma who is all-powerful, none are more powerful, all seeing, with great power and dominion. To see Brahma is the highest of sights. There are the gods of radiant splendor in whom joy flows and overflows and who utter a cry of ‘Joy! Oh joy!’ To hear this is the highest of sounds. There are the all-lustrous gods who feel joy but who rejoice in silence, and this is the highest of joys. There are the gods who go to the sphere of nothingness, and this is the highest of conscious states. Then there are the gods who go to the sphere of neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness, and this is the highest state of being.”</p>

  <p>Then Ananda replied: “But Bhaddaji, what you say is just the talk of the common crowd. Listen, pay attention, and I will speak. If, while one looks, the defilements are destroyed, this is the highest of sights. If, while one listens, the defilements are destroyed, this is the highest of sounds. If, while one rejoices, the defilements are destroyed, this is the highest of joy. If, while one is conscious, the defilements are destroyed, this is the highest of conscious states.

  <p>From the day the Lord said that in four months time he would pass into final Nirvana thousands of people came to wait upon him. Those who had not yet attained the fruits of Stream-Winning could not restrain their tears and those who had not attained enlightenment felt a deep sorrow and walked around in small groups saying: “What will we do?” But one monk named Dhammarama kept separate from the other and when asked what was the matter with him he gave no reply. He had thought to himself: “The Lord has said that in four months time he will attain final Nirvana and I am still not free from desire. Thus, while the Lord lives I will strive to attain enlightenment.” Accordingly, Dhammarama kept to himself, recollecting, pondering and calling to mind the Lord’s Dhamma. The monks went to the Tathagata and said: “Reverend sir, Dhammarama has no affection for you. Since you announced the time of your final Nirvana he has nothing to do with us.” The Lord had Dhammarama called to him and asked: “Is it true what they say, that you have nothing to do with the other monks?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, reverend sir, it is true.”</p>

  <p>“Why do you do this?”</p>

  <p>The wanderer Uttiya asked the Lord: “If, with full comprehension, the good Gotama teaches Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and despair, for the ending of grief and dejection, for reaching the method, for the attaining of Nirvana, then will the whole world attain it, or half of it, or a third?” At these words, the Lord was silent.</p>

  <p>Then Ananda thought: “Uttiya must not be allowed to think that the Lord cannot answer this all-important question.” So Ananda said: "I will give you a simile Uttiya. Imagine a walled town with strong foundation and towers and a single gate. At the gate a watcher who is clever and alert who lets in known people and keeps out strangers. As he patrols the walls he would not see a hole in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip through. And therefore he would know that whatever creatures big or small enter or leave the town, they all do so by the gate. It is the same with the answer to your question, a question that is not important to the Lord. What the Lord says is this. Whoever has escaped, is escaping or will escape from the world, they will do it by abandoning the five hindrances, those defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom; they will do it with mind well-established in the four foundations of mindfulness, and by developing the seven factors of enlightenment.”</p>

  <p>While on tour, the Lord arrived eventually at Parileyya, and there he stayed at the Guarded Forest Grove at the foot of a beautiful sal tree. And as he meditated alone, this thought arose in his mind: “Before, when I was disturbed by those monks at Kosambi, those contentious, quarrelsome, argumentative monks, fighting and making accusations against other monks, I did not live in comfort. But now that I am alone, without another, removed from those contentious monks, I do live in comfort.”</p>

  <p>Now, at that time, a certain large bull elephant was disturbed by other elephants, she-elephants, calves and babes. And it occurred to that elephant: “Now I am disturbed by these other elephants. I eat grass already cropped by them, I break off branches but they eat them, I drink the water they have muddied and when I cross over at the ford they push against my body. What if I were to live alone, secluded from the herd.” So, that elephant left the herd and went to Parileyya, to the Guarded Forest Grove and the beautiful sal tree where the Lord was.</p>

Then that elephant thought: “Before, when I was disturbed by those elephants, I did not live in comfort.

  <p>In the Himalayas, the monarch of the mountains, there are tracts of land which are inaccessible, where neither monkeys nor humans live. But there are other tracts of land, beautiful places, where both monkeys and human do live. In these places, hunters set pitch traps to catch the monkeys. Now, the monkeys who are free from foolishness and greed keep away from the traps. But a foolish and greedy monkey comes along, touches it, and gets his hand stuck. Then, thinking to free his hand, he uses the other hand, but that gets stuck too. To free both hands, he uses a foot which gets stuck, and then the other foot which gets stuck too. Hoping to free both hands and feet, he uses his nose but that gets stuck. And so, trapped in five ways, he lies down and wails, knowing that he is now prey to the hunter who will do what he wants with him.</p>

  <p>If, for as long as it takes to snap a finger, a monk thinks, develops and gives attention to the thought of love, then he is called a true monk. His meditation is not barren, he lives by the Teacher’s instructions, he is one who takes good advice and eats the country’s alms-food to good purpose. What then could I say of one who makes much of such a thought?<br />

  <p>When walking, he is aware: ‘I am walking,’ or when he is standing still, he is aware: ‘I am standing still,’ or when he is sitting down, he is aware: ‘I am sitting down,’ or when he is lying down, he is aware: ‘I am lying down.’ So however his body is disposed, he is aware that it is like that. Again, when he is going or coming, he acts in a clearly conscious way; when he is looking in front or behind, when he has bent or stretched out his arm, when he is carrying his cloak, robe and bowl, he is one who acts in a clearly conscious way. When he is eating, drinking, chewing and tasting, when he is going to the toilet, when he is walking, standing, sitting, asleep or awake, talking or silent, he is one who acts in a clearly conscious way. While he is in this way, diligent, ardent, self-resolute, those memories and plans that are worldly are got rid of, and so by itself the mind is inwardly settled, calmed, focused and concentrated. In this way does one develop mindfulness of the body.</p>

  <p>The Lord said: “Suppose people were to flock together, crying: ‘The fairest girl in all the land. The fairest in the land!’ That girl, displaying all her charms, would dance and sing for them and even more people would gather. Then suppose a man came along, fond of life, not liking death, fond of happiness, averse to pain, and they were to say to him: ‘Here’s a bowl full of oil. You must carry it through the crowd. A man will come behind you with an uplifted sword and if you spill a drop of oil he will chop off your head.’ Now, what do you think? Would that man become inattentive and pay attention to what was going on around him rather than to the bowl?’</p>

  <p>“Surely not, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“Well, this is an analogy I have made for your understanding and this is what it means. The bowl brimful of oil is a term for mindfulness of the body. So, this is how you should train yourself: ‘We shall cultivate mindfulness of the body, we shall make much of it, make it a vehicle, establish it, make it effective.It shall be increased and well applied’ ”</p>

  <p>When the night was fading, Rohitassa, a son of the gods, came to see the Lord, lighting up all the Jeta Grove with a surpassing brilliance, and saluting him stood to one side and asked: “Lord, is it possible by going far to know, to see, to reach the end of the world, that is, where there is no more being born, growing old and dying, no more trudging on from one existence to another?”<br />
  “I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen or reached by going.”<br />
  “Wonderful! Marvelous! This is well said by the Lord. In my last life I was a sage named Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I had such psychic power that I could walk in the sky and my speed was such that I could go faster than an arrow. The extent of my stride was the distance between the east and west ocean. And I thought to myself: ‘I am going to reach the end of the world.’ Except for time spent eating, drinking and answering the call of nature, except for struggles to shake off sleep and weariness, though I lived and traveled for a hundred years, I never reached the end of the world. I died trying.”</p>

  <p>Then the Lord said: “I say that the ending of suffering cannot be found without going to the end of the world.

  <p>It is said that the Sakyans and the Koliyans dammed the waters of the Rohini River between Kapilavatthu and Koliya and cultivated the fields on both sides of the river. During the month of Jetthamula, the crops began to wilt, and the workers employed by both cities assembled. Those of Koliya said: “If the water is diverted to both sides of the river there will not be enough for both of us. As our crops will ripen with a single watering, let us have the water.” But the Sakyans replied: “After your granaries are full, we will not be able to face taking our valuables and with basket and bags in hand, go begging from your doors. Our crops will ripen with a single watering, so let us have the water.”</p>

  <p>“We will not give it to you.”</p>

  <p>“And we will not let you have it.”</p>

  <p>Talk grew bitter, one person struck another, the blow was returned, fighting broke out, and as they fought they cast aspersions upon the origin of the each other’s royal families. The Koliyans workers said: “Take your brats and go where you belong. How can we be harmed by the elephants, horses, shields and weapons of those have slept with their own sisters like dogs and jackals?” The Sakyan workers replied: “You lepers, take your brats and go where you belong. How can we be harmed by the elephants, horses, shields and weapons of miserable outcasts who live up jujube trees like animals.” Both groups went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who were in charge of the work, who in turn reported it to the royal households. The Sakyans prepared for battle, saying: “We will show them the strength and power of those who have slept with their sisters.” The Koliyans prepared for battle, saying: "We will show them the strength and power of those who live up jujube trees.”</p>

  <p>As the Lord surveyed the world at dawn he saw his kinsmen and thought: “If I do not go, these people will destroy each other. It is my duty to go to them.” He passed through the air to where his kinsmen were gathered, and seated himself cross-legged in the air in the middle of the Rohini River. When the Lord’s kinsmen saw him they put down their weapons and worshipped him. Then the Lord said: “What is this quarrel about, great king?”</p>

  <p>“We know not, reverend sir.”</p>

  <p>“Then who would know?”</p>

  <p>“The commander-in-chief of the army will know.”</p>

  <p>When asked, the commander-in-chief suggested the viceroy might know. Thus the Lord asked one after the other with none of them knowing the cause of the quarrel, until the workers were asked. They replied: “The quarrel is about the water.”</p>

  <p>Then the Lord said to the king: “What is the value of water, great king?”</p>

  <p>“Very little, reverend sir.”</p>

  <p>“What is the value of a warrior?”</p>

  <p>“A warrior, reverend sir, is beyond price.” Then the Lord said: “Then is it right that for a little water you should kill warriors who are beyond price?”</p>

  <p>They were all silent. Then the Lord said: “Great kings, why do you act thus? Were I not here today, you would cause a river of blood to flow. Your actions are unworthy. You live in hatred, given to the five kinds of hatred. I live full of love. You live sick with passions. I live free from sickness. You live chasing after the five kinds of sense pleasures.

  <p>Kasi cloth has a beautiful colour, it is pleasant to touch and it is of great value. Even Kasi cloth of middling quality or worn out Kasi cloth is the same. People use worn out Kasi cloth to wrap gems in, or they lay it up in a scented chest. In the same way, if a beginner is virtuous and of lovely nature, this I call his beautiful colour. Those who follow him and keep his company, who pay deference to him and come to share his views find it to their welfare and happiness for a long time. This I call his being pleasant to touch. Also those who give him gifts find it to their advantage. This I call his being of great value. And it is the same for a disciple of middling standing and an elder. Now suppose an elder is speaking to an assembly. As he speaks, the audience would say: ‘Silence, this elder is teaching Dhamma and discipline.’ Thus, his words become a treasure to be laid up, just as people lay up Kasi cloth in a scented chest.

He strives to dispel thoughts of sensuality, ill-will and violence in those oppressed by such thoughts.

  “Yes, my boy, I live happily. Of all the people in the world, I am the happiest.”<br />
  “But sir, these winter nights are cold, the dark half of the month is a time of frost. The ground has been trampled hard by the cattle’s hooves, the carpet of fallen leaves is thin, there are few leaves on the trees, your yellow robe is thin and the winds blow cold.”</p>

  <p>Then he addressed the Lord and said: “Lord, how is understanding fully purified?” The Lord said: “Suppose a man has never seen a kimsuka tree so he goes to a man who has, and asks: ‘What is a kimsuka tree like?’ and that man replies: ‘Well, my man, a kimsuka tree is blackish, something like a charred stump.’ So for the time being, the tree is to him as the other man sees it. Not satisfied with this answer to his question he goes to another man who has seen one, and again puts his question.

  <p>At that time there was a fierce elephant in Rajagaha, a man-killer called Nalagiri. Then Devadatta entered Rajagaha and went to the elephant stable and said to the mahouts: “I am a relative of the king. I am capable of putting one who is in low position into a high position, and arranging for an increase in food and wages. So, my good fellows, when the monk Gotama is coming along the carriage road, let loose Nagaliri and send him down the road.” “Very well, honoured sir,” those mahouts said to Devadatta. In the morning the Lord dressed, and taking his robe, entered the city for alms-food, together with several other monks. As they went down the road, the mahouts released Nalagiri. The elephant saw the Lord coming in the distance, and lifting up his trunk and making his ears and tail erect, he rushed towards him. The monks saw Nagaliri coming and said to the Lord: “Lord, this elephant is a fierce man-killer. Turn back!” The Lord replied: “Do not be afraid, monks, for it is impossible, it cannot happen that someone could kill the Tathagata. The Tathagata cannot attain final Nirvana due to violence.” A second and third time they spoke to the Lord. People climbed on to the roofs of the houses to see what would happen. Those with little faith, those who were not believers, said: “This great monk is beautiful indeed, but he will be harmed by that bull elephant.” But those with faith, those who were believers, said: “Good sirs, soon this great being will confront a truly great being.” Then the Lord suffused Nalagiri with a mind full of love, and the elephant lowered his trunk and went up to the Lord and stood beside him. The Lord stroked Nalagiri’s forehead with his right hand and addressed these verses to him:</p>

  <p>“O elephant, do not strike a truly great being,<br />
  For to do so is painful indeed.<br />
  <br />
  For one who slays a great being, O elephant,<br />
  There is no good rebirth, when one departs from here.<br />
  <br />
  Be not proud, be not reckless,<br />
  Or there will be no good rebirth.<br />
  Act in such a way as to have a good rebirth.”<br />
  <br />
  Then Nalagiri took dust from the Lord’s feet with his trunk, sprinkled it over his own head, and then backed away, bowing, and keeping his gaze on the Lord. He returned to the stable and stood in his own place, and in this way was finally tamed. Then people at that time sang this verse:<br />
  <br />
  “Some are tamed by sticks, by goads or by whips.<br />
  The elephant was tamed by the great seer,<br />
  Without stick or weapon.”<br />
  <br />
  People disparaged and criticized Devadatta widely, saying: “This Devadatta is evil and inauspicious in that he tried to murder the monk Gotama who is of such great psychic power and majesty.” And Devadatta's reputation declined while the Lord’s grew.</p>

  <p>Venerable Tissa, the nephew of the Lord’s father, came to the Lord crying. Then the Lord said to him: “What is wrong, Tissa? Why do you sit beside me sad, downcast and with tears running down your face?”</p>

  <p>“Lord, it is because all the monks have been jeering at and mocking me.”</p>

  <p>“Tissa, that is because while you do not speak gentle words towards others, you are unable to endure it when they do not use gentle words towards you. It is not fitting that you who have given up the household life to become a monk should speak harsh words. But if you do you may have to endure the hard harsh words of others.”</p>

  <p>Thus said the Lord, and he added this verse:</p>

  <p>“Why are you angry Tissa?</p>

  <p>Meekness is best for you,<br />
  To restrain anger, pride and hypocrisy is best.<br />
  It is for this that we live the holy life.”</p>

  <p>How does one practice contemplation on feelings? When experiencing a pleasant feeling, one knows: ‘I am experiencing a pleasant feeling.’ When experiencing a painful feeling, one knows: ‘I am experiencing a painful feeling,’ and when experiencing a neutral feeling, one knows: ‘I am experiencing a neutral feeling.’ When experiencing pleasant, painful or neutral feelings that are worldly, one knows they are worldly, and when experiencing pleasant, painful or neutral feelings that are unworldly, one knows they are unworldly. Thus one dwells contemplating feelings internally and externally. One dwells contemplating the origination factors and the dissolution factors in feelings, or one’s mindfulness that ‘there are feelings’ is established to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. Independent one dwells, clinging to nothing in the world.</p>

  <p>When one has freed the mind, the gods cannot trace him, even though they think: ‘This is the consciousness attached to the Tathagata.’ And why? It is because the Tathagata is untraceable. Although I say this, there are some monks and brahmins who misrepresent me falsely, contrary to fact, saying: ‘The monk Gotama is an annihilationist because he teaches the cutting off, the destruction, the disappearance of the existing entity.’ But this is exactly what I do not teach. Both now and in the past, I simply teach suffering and the overcoming of suffering.</p>

  <p>An ordinary person experiences pleasant, painful and neutral feelings, and so does the instructed noble disciple. So, what is the distinction, the division, the difference between them? When an ordinary person is touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves, laments, beats his breast, weeps and is distraught. Therefore he experiences a bodily feeling and a mental feeling. It is as if a man was pierced by a dart, and following the first piercing, he was hit by a second dart. He would experience the feelings caused by both darts. And so it is with the ordinary man. Having been touched by a painful feeling, he resists and resents it and so a deep tendency of resistance and resentment comes into being. Feeling painful feeling he then tries to enjoy sensual happiness. And why? Because the ordinary person knows no other escape from painful feelings except by enjoying of sensual happiness. Then in enjoying sensual happiness a deep tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes into being. He does not know as it really is the arising and ending of those feelings, their satisfaction, their danger or the escape from them. In lacking this knowledge, the deep tendency to ignorance about neutral feelings comes into being. So whether he feels a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling, he feels it as one fettered by it. He is fettered to birth, old age and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. He is fettered to suffering, I declare.</p>

  <p>But when the instructed noble disciple is touched by a painful feeling, he does not worry, grieve or lament, he does not beat his breast or weep, nor is he distraught. It is one feeling only that he experiences, a bodily one and not a mental one. It is as if a man were pierced by a dart but was not pierced by another dart following the first one. And so it is with the instructed noble disciple. Having been touched by that painful feeling, he neither resists nor resents it, and so no deep tendency for resistance or resentment comes into being. Hence, in consequence of the painful feeling he does not crave for sensual happiness. And why not? Because he knows of an escape from painful feeling other than by enjoying sensual happiness. Then, in not enjoying sensual happiness, no deep tendency to lust for a pleasant feeling comes into being. He knows as it really is the arising and ending of those feelings, their satisfaction, their danger and the escape from them. Knowing this, no deep tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes into being. So whether he feels a pleasant, painful or neutral feeling, he feels it as one free from it. He is free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. He is free from suffering, I declare.</p>

  <p>“So, Sariputta, you do not know the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or even the present. Why then have you spoken so boldly? Why have you roared with the confidence of a lion?”</p>

  <p>“Lord, I know not the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. But the ways of the Dharma, that I do know. Imagine a walled town with strong foundation and towers and a single gate. At the gate a watcher who is clever and alert who lets in known people and keeps out strangers. As he patrols the walls he would not see a hole in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip through. And therefore he would know that whatever creatures big or small enter or leave the town, they all do so by the gate. And it seems to me that the Dhamma is the same. All those noble Buddhas of the past who attained full enlightenment did so by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements that weaken understanding, by firmly establishing the four foundations of mindfulness, and by realizing the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the noble Buddhas of the future will do the same, and you, Lord, who are now a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, have done the same.”</p>

  <p>There are these gross impurities of gold; dust, sand, gravel and grit. The dirt washer or his apprentice heaps the gold into a trough and washes it up and down and flushes the dirt out. When this process is finished there are still moderate impurities in the gold such as fine grit and sand. So the dirt washer repeats the process. When this is finished there still remain minute impurities such as fine sand and dust. So the dirt washer repeats the process again, after which only the gold dust remains. Then the goldsmith or his apprentice puts the gold into a crucible. It is molten but not flawless, it is not yet finished, all the impurities are not yet strained off. It is not yet pliable, workable or glistening, being still brittle and incapable of being perfectly worked. But in time, the goldsmith melts the gold so that it runs from the crucible with all the impurities strained off. Then it is pliable, workable, glistening, no longer brittle, is capable of being perfectly worked. It can be used for whatever purpose one wishes, to make a gold plate, a ring, a necklace or a chain.</p>

  <p>It is just the same for one who is trying to develop the higher mind. Gross impurities of body, speech and mind, the thoughtful, careful one abandons, keeps in check or makes an end of so that they do not recur. When these faults are finished there are still minute impurities which cling to him such as sensual, malicious and cruel thoughts. Again, these he abandons. When these faults are finished there are still minute impurities which cling to him, such as thinking about his relatives, his country or his reputation. Once again the thoughtful, careful one abandons them, keeps them in check, or makes an end of them so that they do not recur. When this is done, there still remain thoughts about Dhamma. At this stage, concentration is neither calm nor lofty, it is not tranquil nor has it reached one-pointedness, it is dependent on habitual restraint. But there comes a time when the mind is inwardly stable, still, one-pointed and concentrated. Such concentration is calm and lofty, it is tranquil and has reached one-pointedness; it is not dependent on habitual restraint. Whatever knowledge one directs his mind to, one can realize it.</p>

Being no boat or bridge for crossing over, that man might think: ‘This bank is dangerous and frightening, while the further bank is safe and secure. But there is neither boat nor bridge for crossing over. What if I collect grass and sticks, branches and leaves, make a raft and by sitting on it and paddling with my hands and feet, I were to cross over to the safe side?’ Say man makes the raft and crosses to the safe side, but then he thinks: ‘By using this raft I have crossed over to the safe side.

  <p>One day as the Lord was seated in the Gandhakuti at the Jeta Grove, he surveyed the world at dawn, and he saw a certain poor man at Alavi. Perceiving that he possessed the faculties needed for attaining the fruit of Stream-Winning, he took a company of five hundred monks and went to Alavi, where the inhabitants invited them to stay. The poor man heard that the Lord had arrived, and decided to go and hear him teach the Dhamma. But that very day his ox strayed off, and he thought: “Shall I go and find my ox or shall I go to hear the Dhamma?” and he decided to find his ox first, setting out early to do so. The people of Alavi gave seats to the monks, with the Buddha at their head, served them food, and when finished, took the Lord’s bowl while he gave thanks. Then the Lord thought to himself: “He for whose sake I came thirty miles has gone to the forest to seek his ox. When he returns, then I will teach the Dhamma.” So, he sat in silence. Before the day was out, the man found his ox and straight away led it back to the herd. Then he thought: “If nothing else, I can go and pay my respects to the Lord,” and thought oppressed by hunger he did not go home, but rather he went quickly to the Lord, and having paid homage, sat respectfully at one side. When the man came close, the Lord said to the steward in charge of food: “Is there any food left over?”</p>

  <p>“Reverend Sir, some food remains untouched.”</p>

  <p>“Then serve this man.”</p>

  <p>After the steward had provided the man with a seat in a place indicated by the Lord, he served him rice gruel and other food both hard and soft, and after the man had eaten, he rinsed his mouth. As soon as the man’s suffering had been relieved, his mind became calm, and then the Lord taught the Dhamma in gradual order, expounding one after the other the Four Noble Truths.

  <p>Venerable Tissa, the nephew of the Lord’s father, spoke to a number of monks and said: “Friends, my body is as if drugged, things have become dim to my eyes, and the Dhamma is no longer clear to me. Sloth and laziness possess my mind and I live the holy life without joy. I waver in the teachings.” So, those monks went to the Lord and told him what Tissa had said, and the Lord addressed one monk saying: “Go, monk, and in my name tell Tissa to come and speak to me.” So that monk did as he was asked and when Tissa came, the Lord said to him: “Is it true as they say that your body is as if drugged, that things have become dim to your eyes, that the Dhamma is no longer clear to you, that sloth and laziness possess your mind, that you live the holy life without joy, and that you waver in the teachings?”</p>

  <p>“That is true, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“Now concerning this, what do you think, Tissa? If one is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, then when the body alters and changes do not grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“And is it not the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“Well said, Tissa! Well said! Now what do you think? If one is free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, then when the body alters and changes then do grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?”</p>

  <p>“No Lord.”</p>

  <p>“And is it the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?”</p>

  <p>“It is, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“Well said, Tissa! Well said! Now, what do you think? Are the body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>

  <p>“They are impermanent, Lord.”</p>

  <p>“So, seeing this, the instructed noble disciple turns away from these five aggregates. Turning away from them, passions fade, and with the fading of passions, he is free and he knows: ‘Rebirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done; there is no more of this.’ Suppose there are two men, one a skilled traveller and the other not. And the unskilled traveller asks the way from the skilled one. He replies: ‘Yes, my good man, this is the way. Continue for a while and you will see a fork in the road. Take the right hand path. Go on a little, and you will come to a forest. Continue for a while more, and you will come to a marshy swamp. Go a little further, and you will see a great cliff. Go further still and you will see a beautiful stretch of open ground.’ I use this parable to illustrate my meaning, and this is the meaning. The man unskilled in travel represents ordinary people, and the man skilled in travel represents the Tathagata, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. The fork in the road is the state of wavering, the left fork being the false eightfold path and the right fork being the Noble Eightfold Path. The thick forest is ignorance, the marshy swamp is desires, and the great cliff is irritation and despair. The delightful stretch of open ground is Nirvana. So be of good cheer, Tissa! Be of good cheer! I will counsel you, I will support you, I will instruct you.”</p>

Let not my body be like that.’ And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. What do you think? Is body permanent or impermanent?”</p>

  <p>“Impermanent, sir.”</p>

  <p>“Now, is what is impermanent painful or pleasant?”</p>

  <p>“Painful, sir.”</p>

  <p>“Now, is it fit to regard what is impermanent and painful like this: ‘This is mine, this is I, this is my self?’ ”</p>

  <p>“No, sir.”</p>

  <p>“And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. So, any kind of body, feeling, perception, mental constructs or consciousness, whether past, present or future, whether gross or subtle, whether internal or external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near, must with right understanding be regarded thus: ‘This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.’ When a noble disciple has heard this and sees this, he becomes detached from body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. Being detached, passions fade, with the fading of passions he is free, and when he is free he knows he is free. He knows: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done, there is no more of this.’ ”</p>

  <p>I will teach you the burden, the taking hold of it, the taking it up, and the putting it down. And what is the burden? The answer is the five clinging aggregates. What five? Body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. This is the burden. And what is the taking hold of the burden? The answer is that it is the person of such-and-such a name, of such-and-such a village. This is the taking hold of the burden. And what is the taking up of the burden? It is that craving for sense pleasures, craving for becoming and craving for unbecoming – that is called lifting up the burden. And what is the putting down of the burden? It is the withering and fading of craving, the giving up of craving, the renouncing of it, freedom from it, the absence of it. That is the putting down of the burden.</p>

  <p>The five aggregates are the burden.<br />
  The seizer of the burden is the person.<br />
  Taking it up is sorrow indeed,<br />
  And putting it down is happiness.<br />

Then the master said: ‘Now, my boy, you protect me and I will protect you, and protected and watched by each other we will do our act, get a good fee, and come down safe and sound from the bamboo pole.’ But then the pupil said: ‘No master, no! That will not do. You look after yourself, and I will look after myself and thus watched and guarded each by himself, we will do our act, get a good fee, and come down safe and sound from the bamboo pole. That is the way to do it.’</p>

  <p>Then the Lord said: “Just as the pupil said to the master: ‘I will protect myself’ so should you practice the four foundations of mindfulness, which also means: ‘I will protect others.’ Because by protecting oneself, one protects others and by protecting others, one protects oneself. And how does one protect others by protecting oneself? It is by the repeated and frequent practice of meditation. And how does one protect oneself by protecting others?

He might hear someone speaking of the pleasure of a lovely, unstained, pure white cloth, and start searching for one. But someone might deceive him by giving him a greasy, grimy, coarse robe and say: ‘My good man, this is lovely, unstained, pure white cloth.’ The blind man might take it and put it on. Then his friends and relations might get a physician or surgeon to make medicine for him, potions, purgatives, ointments and treatment for his eyes. Because of this he might regain his sight and restore his vision. Then the desire and attachment he had for that greasy robe would go, he would no longer consider the man who gave it to him a friend. He might even consider him an enemy, thinking: ‘For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by this man.’ Even so, if I were to teach you Dhamma, saying: ‘This is that health, this is that Nirvana,’ you might come to know health, you might see Nirvana. With the arising of that vision, the desire and attachment you had for the five clinging aggregates might go. You might even think: ‘For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by the mind, by clinging to body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. Conditioned by this clinging there was becoming; conditioned by becoming there was birth, conditioned by birth, old age, dying, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair came into being. This is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.’ And Magandiya said to the Lord: “I have confidence that if the good Gotama were to teach me Dhamma, I could rise from my seat no longer blind.”</p>
